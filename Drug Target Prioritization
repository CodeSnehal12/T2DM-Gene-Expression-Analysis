Functional Analysis:
Functional and Pathway Enrichment Analysis:
Three categories of GO enrichment results and KEGG pathway analysis were performed to elucidate the biological processes and pathways associated with the differentially
expressed genes (DEGs).
A. Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment Analysis:
1. Biological Process (BP):
- DEGs were significantly enriched in processes related to negative regulation of
intercellular signal transduction (GO:1902532), protein catabolic process (GO:0030163),
and hemopoiesis (GO:0030697).
2. Cellular Component (CC):
- Enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment of DEGs in cellular components
such as secretory granule lumen (GO:0034774), insulin receptor complex
(GO:0005899), and membrane raft (GO:0045121).
3. Molecular Function (MF):
- DEGs were found to be enriched in molecular functions including protein kinase
binding (GO:0019901), kinase activity (GO:0016301), and insulin-like growth factorreceptor binding (GO:0005159).
B. KEGG Pathway Analysis:
- KEGG pathway analysis identified significant associations of DEGs with pathways
including Alzheimer's disease (hsa:05010), longevity regulation (hsa:04211), IL-17
signaling pathway (hsa:04657), and prostate cancer (hsa:05215).
C. Network Analysis(strng image, cluster 2 image)
Network analysis tools, including STRING, MCODE, and CentiScape, were utilized to
identify key functional interactions and hub genes within the differentially expressed
gene network.
Analysis Steps:
1. PPI Network Construction:
- The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using STRING, resultingin a network with 215 nodes and 258 edges after removing nodes that could not
interact with other nodes.
2. Module Identification with MCODE:
- MCODE was used to screen out the core genes that constitute the stable structure of
the PPI network with degree cut‐off = 2, haircut on, node score cut‐off = 0:2,
k score = 3, and maximum depth = 100. MCODE analysis was performed to identify
densely connected regions (clusters) within the PPI network. A total of 2 clusters were
generated, and 19 core genes were identified as part of these clusters.
3. Centrality Analysis with CentiScape:
- CentiScape plugin was used to compute centrality measures for the 19 core genes
identified. Hub genes were defined as those with a degree value ≥ mean + 2 standard
deviations (SD), and bottleneck genes were defined as those with a betweenness value
≥ mean + 2 SD. From this analysis, 2 hub genes and 1 bottleneck gene were obtained.
Core gene :- UBE2H,UBE2R2,UBE2E3,TRIP12,UBE3A,CASP8,BCL2L1, DCAF12,CEACAM8, MAPK14, ALAS2,APP, HP, LCN2, CXCL10,SLCGA1,TRIM58, LTF, STAT1
Hub gene :- CASP8, BCL2L1
Bottleneck gene :- BCL2L1. 
Candidate Gene Selection:
- Candidate gene were selected based on the intersection of the above three
datasets (MCODE clusters(core genes) , hub genes, and bottleneck genes). The gene
"BCL2L1" was identified as a candidate gene for further analysis.
